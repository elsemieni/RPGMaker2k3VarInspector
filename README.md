## Download
You can download last version in [Releases](https://github.com/elsemieni/RPGMaker2k3VarInspector/releases) section. 
## Instructions
Basic instructions are following.

 - Select your version of RPG_RT of your game that you will use with this tool.
 - Execute your game and set a switch and a variable before. That's important beacuse without setting them the tool will be unable to detect the executable(*).
 - Click on (Re)Attach RPG_RT to connect the tool to the RPG_RT process.
 - Start adding variables and/or switches that you want to live inspect.

By tool limitations you must add the switches/variables that you want to see. You can do it with Add button. Also you can save your variable listings for future use (so you can setup your watches once). 

<sub><sup>(*) RPG_RT does not initialize variables at bootup, instead it only creates it when you set a one, until that value. That means if you set Variable ID 100, the program will just initialize variables from 1 to 100. So, for using variable 1000 you must initialize first by setting a value on it (or in a higher variable ID). If you don't initalize it you will see random values on it (and if you don't initialize any variable you will get an error beacuse the tool will be unable to locate them).</sub>
